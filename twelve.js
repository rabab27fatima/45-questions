// Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, 
// print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, 
// but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.
//Repeat exercise 11 array.
let names1 = ["Anam", "Shajia", "Rabab", "Sidra", "Aatka"];
// Print personalized message to each friend.
names1.forEach(name => {
    console.log(`Dear, ${name} Keep Shining!`);
